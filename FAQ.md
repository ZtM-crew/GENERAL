# FAQ



**What we are doing?**\
We are a community to creating web applications together, especially to make your web developer portfolio 
more impressive for your future employer or contractor.

**What I need to do to contribute in a project?**\
Only a decision. And a free [Trello.com](https://trello.com/) account where our development work taking place. 
Additional tool access can be suggested but all of them are free services. As soon as you got a Trello account send your 
username to the Project Lead or one of the member of the management.

**What kind of projects are we making and who decides?**\
Everything is based on the community. Usually when we finished a project, we start to gather ideas from the members 
and the most voted idea will be created.

**Who can introduce their idea?**\
Anyone. If you have a project idea or a dream website, share your idea with a short intro, what the site does and main functionality.

**What happens if my idea won?**\
In that case your idea is something worth to make it real. Traditionally the member whos idea won, will be the Project Lead 
during the development. Most importantly he is the one who sees clearly what direction the development should go.

**What does a Project Lead does?**\
During the planning process a lot of ideas and suggestions appear, he needs to decide which one fits to his original idea. 
Also needs a commitment for the entire development as his responsibility to make sure everyone understand the project goals 
and the project will be finished.

**What if I do not have much of technical or managing experience?**\
No problem at all. Our experienced team members can help you with any question.

**Then the Project Lead is the owner of the site?**\
No. There is no owner. Our projects are volunteer, community developed, open sourced software. Strictly for practicing, 
learning and portfolio purposes. The original source code will be placed on the community's Github account. Every member's name, 
who contributed until the finish of the project, will be credited.

**What if any of our projects goes viral or requires more resources than free services can provide 
or becomes a commercial oppurtunity?**\
Our initial mission to give opportunity for beginners or fresh professionals to practice, learn and work in a team. 
That is why all of our development and hosting solutions has to be free of charge. In a case when one of our project 
has an opportunity to become a commercial product, the necessary legal decisions will be made equally among the members 
who contributed in the project.

**How does the development process work?**\
After an idea and the Project Lead has been choosen, we start the planning process.

	Stage 1:

		The Project Lead has to do a detailed pitch of the following points:
		- What is the name of the site?
		- What does the website do, what is the purpose?
		- What are the main functionalities and features?

	Stage 2:

		After the above are clarified we need a wireframe/layout of the site, it is a graphical version 
		how the site should look like. If possible, a prototype would be the best for better understanding. 
		The prototype is a clickable demo to show the features without any coding.

	Stage 3:

		If the Project Lead is satisfied with the wireframe/layout, the team decides what kind of technical 
		solutions, libraries and framework we will use.
		By default we use React.js, Node.js/Express and SQL. Additional or substitutional decisions based 
		on common agreement.

	Stage 4:

		When the planning process finished the Management team and the Project Lead start breaking down 
		the project to smaller tasks and provides them on Trello. All of the tasks are available from the 
		beginning and the members decides which one they want to work on. Additional tasks can be added, 
		based on issues or dependencies during the development.

	Stage 5:

		When all the necessary planning steps are done, we provide the link to our Github repository 
		to fork the project. You pick a task card on Trello and you are free to start coding. When your 
		task is done and sure is working fine, commit to your forked repo and make a Pull Request. 
		If there is any additional info you want to share, please add a comment straight into the card 
		and move to the Done/Release section. 
		Your Pull Request will be reviewed and accepted as soon as possible, however you can let the 
		management team knows about your recent PR.


**What if I feel my skills are way behind the other's?**\
Obviously a basic web developing knowledge are necessary to contribute, but if you finished or at least started a 
course or bootcamp and you know the concept of web programming and you can efficiently use any search site, it should not be a problem.
The actual coding process is quiet but difficult process, that is why we encourage everyone to let the others know if facing 
any difficulties, to get the necessary help as soon as possible. It can be very demotivational and overwhelming when someone 
struggling with a problem for hours or days with no luck. 


Most importantly please do not afraid to ask help, even if you think the others are more experienced and you feel your issue 
might be embarassing. In programming there is no noob problem and also we do not tolerate any desctructive behaviour, 
our community is about the team, not individuals' ego. So please do not hesitate to share any question or issues, everyone is here 
to learn and improve their skills. 

#### I wish a wonderful journey to build your idea or be a part of one. At the end of the day it is our common project.
